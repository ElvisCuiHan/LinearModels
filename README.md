- Topics include: 
  1. Matrix theory with an emphasis on projection operators.
  2. Distribution theory, especially Fisher-Cochran's theorem.
  3. Multiple and partial correlation coefficients.
  4. Violation of assumptions in linear models and remedies.
  5. Hypothesis testing such as omnibus test, Fieller's theorem, Cook-Weiesberg's test, etc.
  6. Simultaneous inference such as Tukey's q, Scheffe's method, etc.
  7. Shrinkage and Bayes estimation (an unusual version of James-Stein estimator and its statisticla properties).
  8. ANOVA mixed models.
  9. Linear mixed models with REML.
- Course materials are included.
- Homework are included with my own solutions.
